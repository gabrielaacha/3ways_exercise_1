# Exercise 1 solution 1

* created an emty counter called sumMarks, default value 0;
* created a variable called realAverage with default value 0, in order to calculate the average mark out of the 6 marks
* then I created a loop in order to go through the array and perform calculations
* then I added each index of the array to the sumMarks variable, so each value will be added up
* then I calculated the read average dividing the average between the amount of marks (6). I used math.floor to round up the number (get the decimals out)
* then I created a multiple condition, each line returning a final mark (A+,A,B,C,F)
console.log to visualise the result in the terminal
I console.logged the function call
